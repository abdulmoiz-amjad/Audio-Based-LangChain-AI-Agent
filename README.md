# Audio-Based-LangChain-AI-Agent
This project fine-tunes a large language model using PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and integrates it into a Streamlit app. The app acts as a creative assistant to help users generate stories, recipes, and poetry, optimized to adapt to user moods.
